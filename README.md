# Capistrano Foreman

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/hyperoslo/capistrano-foreman.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hyperoslo/capistrano-foreman)

Capistrano tasks for foreman and upstart.

## Installation

    $ gem install capistrano-foreman

Add this to your config/deploy.rb:

    require "foreman/capistrano"



Specify the concurrency for each process by defining ENV variables in a ```.env``` file in your application root dir.
```FOREMAN_WEB=3``` will create 3 instances of the process defined as 'web' in your Procfile.
```
web: bundle exec rails server thin -p $PORT  -e $RACK_ENV
```

Remember to run ```cap foreman:export``` after changing the ENV variables.


## Usage

Export Procfile to upstart:

    $ cap foreman:export

Restart the application services:

    $ cap foreman:restart
